Anser 4: Tag ->HTML uses a system of "tags" to define the structure and layout of web pages.
 Tags are the building blocks of HTML documents and consist of angle brackets 
enclosing specific keywords.
These tags provide instructions to web browsers on how to display the content.
An HTML tag is composed of an opening tag and, in some cases, a closing tag. The opening tag starts with
the less-than symbol (<), followed by the tag name, and ends with a greater-than symbol (>). The closing
tag is similar, but it also includes a forward slash (/) before the tag name.
For Example:
Opening tag: <tagname>
Closing tag: </tagname>
HTML tags can be broadly categorised into two types:
 
1-Paired Tags (or Container Tags):
Paired tags have both an opening and a closing tag and can contain other HTML elements and text within
them. They define a specific section or structure in the web page. Some common paired tags include:
Some common examples are <html>, <head>, <p>, <span> etc...
2-Singular Tags (or Void Tags):
In HTML, some are self-closing tags or void tags because they don't require a separate closing tag. These
elements are used for elements that don't contain any content or don't have a closing counterpart.
Example: <img/>, <input/>, <br/>, and <meta/> etc.


Element: HTML elements are the building blocks of an HTML document. HTML elements 
consist of a start tag, an end tag (if applicable), and content in between the tags.
The start tag defines the beginning of an HTML element, and the end tag defines 
the end of an HTML element.
Each HTML element has a specific structure that defines its behaviour and 
appearance on a web page.

Ex: - <opening tag>content </close tag>
 <h1>We can write content here</h1>

Here is a breakdown of the anatomy of an HTML element:

1-Opening tag - This is the opening tag that defines the beginning of an HTML element.
 It is enclosed in angle brackets (< >)

2- Content - This is the text or other data that appears between the start and end
 tags of an HTML element.Some HTML elements do not require content and are self-closing

3- Closing tag - This is the closing tag that defines the end of an HTML element. It is enclosed in angle
brackets with a forward slash (/) before the element name.
